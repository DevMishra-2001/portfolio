        <h3>Who is frontend developer</h3>
        <p class="p2">
            A front end developer is someone who implements web designs through programming
             languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
             The front end developers work with the design and outlook of the website. Whereas, the back end developers program what goes on behind the scenes like databases. If you head to any site, you can see the work of a front end developer in the navigation, layouts, and also the way a site looks different from your phone.


        </p>
        <h3>Who is backend Developer</h3>
        <p class="p3">Back-end developers are the experts who build and 
            maintain the mechanisms that process data and 
            perform actions on websites. Unlike front-end developers, 
            who control everything you can see on a website,
            back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see.
